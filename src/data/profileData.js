    "I'm a developer who believes that code is more than just logic—it's a medium for storytelling. My journey started with a curiosity for how things work on the web, which quickly evolved into a passion for building immersive digital experiences.",
    "Specializing in the React ecosystem, I bridge the gap between robust engineering and fluid design. I call my style 'Liquid Glass'—a philosophy that prioritizes clarity, depth, and smooth motion in every interface I create.",
    "When I'm not refining pixel-perfect UIs, you'll find me exploring the latest in cloud architecture, contributing to open source, or finding inspiration in video game design."
